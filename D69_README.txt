 Potato Disease Detection Project

This project focuses on classifying potato plant images into three categories: early blight, late blight, and healthy. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Plant Village dataset available on Kaggle.

Dataset

- Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village/data
- Classes:
  - Early blight
  - Late blight
  - Healthy (no disease)

Models

 AlexNet Model

- Description: AlexNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture used for image classification.


 RNN Model

- Description: The RNN model is used for sequence classification of preprocessed feature vectors.
